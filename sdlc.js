// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain




//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = 'The second step is when developers gather all the necessary requirements and functionality needed to make the program work for its end-users'
const design = 'The third step is when developers design the program architecture, how the code will be written, how the various tech stacks will interact. It is similar to \'planning\' but much more detailed.'
const implementation = 'After planning, gathering requirements, and designing the program, developers will then implement the plans and actually write the code'
const testingAndIntegration = 'Once the code has been completed, developers will test to ensure the code works properly and that the tech stack works as designed. Any system migration is executed and end-users begin to use the program'
const maintain = 'The final step is to continuously improve the code, debug issues, and make improvements based on user feedback'
